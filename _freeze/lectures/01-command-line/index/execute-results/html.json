Install a Unix shell on your computer (if it is not already installed)\n2. How to access and open the Unix shell on your computer\n3. How to type commands on the Unix shell\n\n:::\n\nIn addition, please read through Chapters 1-7\n\n- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro>\n- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir>\n- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create>\n- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-pipefilter>\n- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop>\n- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script>\n- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find>\n\n\n::: callout-note\n\n## How much should I prepare for before class? \n\nYou should be comfortable with the meaning of most the commands and also executing commands in a Unix shell on your computer before class starts. \n\nDuring class, I will give an overview of working in the Unix shell and then we will practice the commands with an in-class activity. If you have not opened a Unix shell before or you are not comfortable with executing commands, it will be challenging to participate in the activity.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n# Lecture \n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nMaterial for this lecture was borrowed and adopted from\n\n- [Software Carpentry: The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice)\n- [Data Science at the Command line](https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e)\n\n## Learning objectives\n\n::: callout-note\n### Learning objectives\n\n**At the end of this lesson you will:**\n\n-   Understand what is a command shell and why would use one.\n-   Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.\n-   Create, copy, move, rename, and delete files and folders.\n-   Print and sort file contents.\n-   Search for regular expressions in files.\n-   Execute R commands and scripts in the command line.\n-   Redirect a command’s output to a file with redirect operators (`>`, `>>`).\n-   Construct command pipelines with two or more stages with the pipe operator (`|`).\n-   Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.\n-   Explain why spaces should not be used in file names inside of loops.\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\nYou can practice your command-line skills with the [Command Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/)\n\n:::\n\n## Slides \n\n- Will be posted here. <add here>\n\n\n# Post-lecture\n\n## Summary \n\n- Shell is a text based application for viewing, handling and manipulating files\n- It is also known by the following names\n    - CLI (Command Line Interface)\n    - Terminal\n    - Bash (Bourne Again Shell)\n- Use `Rscript -e` or `R -e` to execute R scripts from the command line\n- RStudio includes a Terminal (from version 1.1.383)\n- Execute commands from shell script in RStudio using Ctrl + Enter\n- RMarkdown and Quarto supports bash, sh and awk\n\n## Additional practice\n\nHere are some additional practice questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1. Explore the help files of `tar` and `gzip` commands for compressing files.\n2. Move around the computer, get used to moving in and out of directories, see how different file types appear in the Unix shell. Be sure to use the `pwd` and `cd` commands, and the different flags for the `ls` commands. \n3. Practice using \"Tab for Auto-complete\" in the shell to autocomplete commands or file names.\n4.
